all dependencies listed in requirements.txt
install them with

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

then to built all the project files run 

$ python 6140_chess.py

That script will place files into pkl/, csv/ and fig/ directories:
pkl/ - preprocessed data and trained models stored as pkl files
csv/ - predictions made by models on the different datasets
fig/ - graphs made from predictions

Note: test_pgn.zip, train_pgn.zip, and validation_pgn.zip are supposed to be in the submission folder and you will need to unzip the three files in the submission folder and then run the procedure mentioned above.
